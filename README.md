ETL data pipeline for data from MySQL data base on cloud (cloud SQL) to BigQuery

For business reason, database and data warehouse are both useful for a company to save, check, and study its inventory state.

For those I wish to send Inventory data from MySQL database to BigQuery without coding for the pipeline design, I use leverage Googleâ€™s Cloud Data Fusion to accomplish this goal. 
This pipeline can integration batch data from a Cloud MySQL Server database to a BigQuery table.



The whole configurations may involve the following steps:

Set up MSSQL Server database to enable replication
Create and run a Cloud Data Fusion Replication job
View the results in BigQuery
